BY GETTING RID OF NUCLEAR WASTE STOP DESERTIFICATION AND DROUGHT FOR ZERO MONEY


My technology RBI101 is patented solution for the permanent and safe disposal of nuclear waste (http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO2022058765) which simultaneously solves the problem of desertification and drought. It is based on the true concept of atom [1] and the true laws and concepts of creation [2].

It implies distribution of all nuclear waste deep into the sand of world’s deserts in very small quantities, over vast thousands of miles deserts areas. The distribution should be done either by plowing very deep furrows for thousands of miles, and placing very small quantities of nuclear waste at the very bottom of the furrows, or by using a drilling technique to perform the same task. The depths where small amounts of nuclear waste should be placed must be determined experimentally so that no leakage of the radioactive radiation to the surface of a desert can occur. Bringing nuclear waste underground into its natural proper place, deep into the desert sand, and distributing it in very small amounts over vast desert areas, enables the nuclear waste to fulfill its necessary useful purpose, which is preparing the soil for organic life - oxygen dependent life - to live, by causing underground countless billions of microscopic explosions within the desert sand to release water and create fertile soil (humus, nitrogen, carbonic gas, oxygen and water) for organic life and other necessities for vegetation and human life. 

The RBI101 natural solution for nuclear waste management [3], with simultaneous solution of desertification and drought problem, promotes the Nature's supreme principle that there is GOOD in everything and enables turning over all these “negative” precepts into the following great GOOD for both the planet and humanity: 

1. Integration of all nuclear waste (low, middle and high level) into natural life cycle in a manner that the problem of nuclear waste is solved FOREVER with 100% efficiency - there is no slightest chance that it could ever provide any kind of danger for the life on this planet,

2. Prevention of drought and turning world’s deserts into agricultural areas and forests,

3. Bringing the Earth’s atmosphere back into balance and prevention of the possible inevitable climate catastrophe,

4. Reestablishment of the natural level of oxygen in air and waters, 

5. Creation of new food sources worldwide, especially in regions where hunger is a big problem, and 
5. Creation of millions of new workplaces worldwide.

The RBI101 is the copy of the Nature’s way of purposeful dealing with radioactive elements so that they can fulfill the Nature’s supreme principle of BALANCE in the Creation. There are irrefutable examples in Nature which are indisputable proofs for the inevitable functionality of the RBI101 technology.  

Finally, the outstanding advantage of the RBI101 technology is that it doesn’t require any investment, if money that is necessary for keeping nuclear waste as safe as possible, would be used for implementation of this technology. This technology would provide on a long run multi-trillion profits.

This is my gift for saving our Mother Earth, but before the final implementation a demo small scale project must be completed. Namely, a small desert area must be safely “seeded” with nuclear waste in order to verify creation of fertile soil and forests at the surface.

In order to accomplish a demo project money is needed.

All of you, who love yourself and love Mother Earth, could contribute to this adventure either by spreading out the word or by donating for realization of a demo project, or both.

In either case I’m sincerely thankful and bless you with my Light.
